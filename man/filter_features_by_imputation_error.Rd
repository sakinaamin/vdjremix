\title{Filter repertoire features based on imputation error}
\usage{
filter_features_by_imputation_error(
  feature_matrix,
  benchmark_results,
  method = "missForest",
  rmse_threshold = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_matrix}{Numeric matrix or data.frame (samples × features).}

\item{benchmark_results}{Output from benchmark_imputation().}

\item{method}{Character. Imputation method used for filtering (default "missForest").}

\item{rmse_threshold}{Numeric. RMSE cutoff above which features are removed.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{filtered_matrix}{Feature matrix after removing poorly imputed features.}
\item{removed_features}{Character vector of removed feature names.}
\item{summary}{Data frame summarising filtering decisions.}
}
\description{
Removes features that cannot be reliably imputed given their observed
level of missingness, based on RMSE benchmarking.
}
\details{
A feature is removed if its RMSE exceeds the threshold at any NA-seeding
frequency less than or equal to its observed missingness.
